# Lectures

### Lecture 1: The Square Kilometre Array and its Science [[link](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/LECTURES/SquareKilometreArray.pdf)]

This lecture gives an introduction to radio telescopes and interferometry. It describes the [Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope](www.skatelescope.org) and some of the [key science areas](https://www.skatelescope.org/science/) that will be addressed by this new instrument. It goes on to explain how radio interferometers make measurements of the sky. 

#### Reading material:

* [Chapter 3.7](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch3.html#S7) of the [Essential Radio Astronomy](https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/courses/era) course by Jim Condon & Scott Ransom provides a good introduction to interferometry. (Personally I still like [the earlier version of this course](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/ERA_old.shtml).)

* [Chapter 3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44431-4_3) of [Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-44431-4) by Thompson, Moran & Swenson gives a more detailed explanation of the interferometer response.

* You can read about the MeerKAT radio telescope [here](http://www.ska.ac.za/science-engineering/meerkat/).

### Lecture 2: Indirect Imaging in the SKA Era [[link](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/LECTURES/IndirectImaging.pdf)]

This lecture starts with [a primer on Fourier transforms](https://allofyourbases.com/2017/09/11/furrier-cats/). It then gives an introduction to making images using data from radio interferometers (starting from the end of Lecture 1) and describes why this is computationally challenging for the SKA. 

#### Reading material:

* [Chapter 10](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-44431-4_10) of [Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-44431-4) by Thompson, Moran & Swenson gives an introduction to interferometric imaging.

* [This paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005ASPC..347...86C) by Tim Cornwell talks about w-projection for wide field imaging.

* [This document](http://ska-sdp.org/sites/default/files/attachments/ska-tel-sdp-0000013_06_performancemodel_0.pdf) from the SKA [Science Data Processor (SDP)](http://ska-sdp.org) design consortium provides a parametric model for the computational complexity of the imaging pipeline for the SKA.

#### Python Notebooks:

* You can make your own Fourier/Furrier Cat with [this notebook](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/TUTORIALS/FourierCat.ipynb).
* This lecture is accompanied by [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/TUTORIALS/SimulateInterferometer.ipynb).

### Lecture 3: Real time classification at SKA-scale for time domain astrophysics [[link](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/LECTURES/RealTimeClassification.pdf)]

This lecture starts with an introduction to [pulsars](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/distance/frontiers/pulsars/section1.html) and their use for detecting gravitational waves. It then describes how pulsars are selected out of radio data. It goes on to describe how pulsar classification is an imbalanced machine learning problem and how that can be addressed. It finishes by describing the real-time [streamed classification method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.2278) expected to be used by the SKA.

#### Reading material:

* You can read all about pulsars (and find the animations from the lecture) on the [Jodrell Bank website](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/distance/frontiers/content.htm).

* [50 years of pulsar candidate selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05166.pdf) by [Rob Lyon](http://www.scienceguyrob.com) et al.

* [A Processing Pipeline for High Volume Pulsar Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06012.pdf) by [Rob Lyon](http://www.scienceguyrob.com) et al.

#### Audio/Visual Material:

* [Listen to pulsar B0329+54](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/LECTURES/AUDIO) and [other pulsars on the Jodrell Bank website](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/distance/frontiers/pulsars/section1.html)

* Check out this [beautiful visualisation of all the known pulsars](http://www.ishivvers.com/maps/pulsars.html) by Isaac Shivvers.

#### Python Notebooks:

* This lecture is accompanied by [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/as595/NITheP/blob/master/TUTORIALS/PulsarClassifier.ipynb).

* [Rob Lyon](http://www.scienceguyrob.com)'s [machine learning tutorials for pulsar classification](https://github.com/astro4dev/OAD-Data-Science-Toolkit/tree/master/Teaching%20Materials/Machine%20Learning/Supervised%20Learning/Examples/PPC) are available as part of the [IAU OAD Data Science Toolkit](https://github.com/astro4dev/OAD-Data-Science-Toolkit).
